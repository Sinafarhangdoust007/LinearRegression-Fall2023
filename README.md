# Bike Rental Prediction

## Description
This Python project predicts the number of bikes rented based on weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and visibility. It uses a linear regression model to make predictions from a dataset of bike rentals.

## Features
- Reads and processes a dataset of bike rental data.
- Trains a linear regression model to predict bike rentals.
- Allows users to input weather parameters to get a prediction.

## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00560/SeoulBikeData.csv). It includes information on temperature, humidity, wind speed, visibility, and rented bike count.
